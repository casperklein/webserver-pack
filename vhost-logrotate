# daily			# Log files are rotated daily|weekly|monthly|yearly.
# size=10M		# Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than X bytes.
# missingok		# If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without issuing an error message.
# rotate 10		# Log files are rotated X times before being removed.
# compress		# Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip.
# delaycompress		# Postpone compression of the previous log file to the next rotation cycle.
# notifempty		# Do not rotate the log if it is empty.
# create 640 root root	# Immediately after rotation (before the postrotate script is run) the log file is created (with the same name as the log file just rotated).
# sharedscripts		# If sharedscripts is specified, the scripts are only run once, no matter how many logs match the wildcarded pattern.
# postrotate		# The lines between postrotate and endscript are executed (using /bin/sh) after the log file is rotated.
